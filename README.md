## JavaScript Projects

##### Doctors Got Help
A web page built using vanilla javascript to allow doctors to create a prescription slip using speech recognition API. The idea is to train it in such a way that medicines are easily recognised when spoken [TO DO].

##### Edit Distance Algorithm Viusaliser
The Levenshtein distance (a.k.a edit distance) is a measure of similarity between two strings. It is defined as the minimum number of changes required to convert string a into string b (this is done by inserting, deleting or replacing a character in string a). I coded a table using dynamic programming approach to visualise the changes.

##### Relativity And Blackholes
Created a web-page to simulate some relativity concepts with javascript and used Web-GL to demonstrate an interactive blachole as part of CS 212 end-of-semester project.
